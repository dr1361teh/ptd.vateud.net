    <h1>Dear <%= @pilot.name %></h1>
    <p>
      Most unfortunately you have failed your <%= @pilot.rating.name %> rating practical examination
      within VATEUD PTD with a score of <%= @pilot.practical_score || "[undefined]" %>.<br/>
    </p>
    <p>
      You can expect a contact from one of our instructors to assist you with preparation
      and training before continuing further.
