Dear VATEUD PTD Administrator,

  A pilot has requested a theory exam token reissue for <%= @pilot.rating.name %> rating!
  
  Pilot details:

  Name: <%= @pilot.name %>
  VATSIM ID: <%= @pilot.vatsimid %>
  Email: <%= @pilot.email %>
  Division: <%= @pilot.division.name %>
  vACC: <%= @pilot.vacc %>
  ATC rating: <%= @pilot.atc_rating.name %>


  After reissuing the token in ATSimTest, you can manage his record and
  mark the "token reissued" checkbox in the pilot's profile
  at ptd.vateud.net/admin

  The pilot will be notified when the token is reissued.

Have a great day!
