Dear <%= @pilot.name %>
==============================

As part of your <%= @pilot.rating.name %> training within VATEUD PTD you have been issued
a theoretical exam token, which means you are now allowed to sit your <%= @pilot.rating.name %> written test.

In order to do that please go to http://www.atsimtest.com and
log in with your VATSIM credentials. Then click on the "My Status" link and look at the
"Opportunities" section: you'll see there's a <%= @pilot.rating.name %> test waiting there for you.
After completing the test your results will be evaluated and recorded by our staff and you will

Good luck and have a great day!
