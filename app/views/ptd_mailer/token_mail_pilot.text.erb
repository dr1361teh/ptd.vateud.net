Dear <%= @pilot.name %>
==============================

As part of your <%= @pilot.rating.name %> training within VATEUD PTD you have been issued
a theoretical exam token, which means you are now allowed to sit your <%= @pilot.rating.name %> written test.

In order to do that please go to http://www.atsimtest.com and
log in with your VATSIM credentials. Then click on the "My Status" link and look at the
"Opportunities" section: you'll see there's a <%= @pilot.rating.name %> test waiting there for you.
After completing the test your results will be evaluated and recorded by our staff and you will
continue your further training in preparation for your practical examination.


Be advised, that ATSimTest theory exams are only valid for 1 month after starting them and 3 months after finishing and submitting them. Hence, you'll need to complete your practical exam within 3 months of passing the theoretical one, in order to be upgraded to your desired rating.


Good luck and have a great day!

*VATEUD Pilot Training Department Team*
