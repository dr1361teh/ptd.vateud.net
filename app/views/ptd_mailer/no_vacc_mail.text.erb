    Dear Pilot, 

    We received your application for the VATEUD PTD. You’re already a 
    VATEUD member however there is required one last step before we can continue 
    to the theoretical examination. 

    In order you can make the theoretical test via the ATSimTest web based 
    platform you must be assigned into a vACC (Virtual Area Control Center). vACC’s 
    normally reflect in some way your nationality as there are organized associations 
    for each country that have studying materials, documentations and most important 
    members from your country that will certainly help you creating a sense of 
    community. 

    We suggest visiting this link for informations about European vACC’s: 
    http://api.vateud.net/subdivisions. You will probably find more information about 
    the registration process in the respective vACC’s webpages

    After you complete the registration in your vACC you must personally email 
    vateud3@vateud.net or vateud11@vateud.net in order to complete your 
    registration process, alerting the fact that you are finally a vACC assigned pilot. 

    Yours Sincerely, 

  *VATEUD Pilot Training Department Team*
