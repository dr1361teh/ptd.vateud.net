Dear VATEUD PTD Administrator,

A pilot's <%= @pilot.rating.name %> rating theory exam has just expired!

  Pilot details:

  Name: <%= @pilot.name %>
  VATSIM ID: <%= @pilot.vatsimid %>
  Email: <%= @pilot.email %>
  Division: <%= @pilot.division.name %>
  vACC: <%= @pilot.vacc %>
  ATC rating: <%= @pilot.atc_rating.name %>


The pilot has been notified about the expiration and advised to request
a theory exam token re-issue. Once he does that, you'll receive a notification.
Use the "token reissued" checkbox in the pilot profile to notify the pilot of the re-issue, 
so that he can continue with his rating training and examinations.

You can manage his record at ptd.vateud.net/admin

Have a great day!

*VATEUD Pilot Training Department Team*
