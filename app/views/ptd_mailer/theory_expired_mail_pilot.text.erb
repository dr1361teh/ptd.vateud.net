Dear <%= @pilot.name %>

It's now been 180 days since you took your <%= @pilot.rating.name %> rating theory test
within VATEUD PTD and its validity has expired. You need to re-sit the theoretical exam
before you proceed to the practical one.


You can request a theory exam token re-issue from your personal EUD PTD profile
at the following address: http://ptd.vateud.net/pilots/<%=@pilot.slug %>    

The re-issue request will be processed by our staff and then you can proceed further with your training.

Have a great day!

*VATEUD Pilot Training Department Team*
